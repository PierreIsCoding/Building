I wanted to have a library and quick access to all the little circuit snippets I learned during the many Eurorack modules I designed so far. By having these circuit snippets ready with accompanying Falstad simulations I would be able to just drag and drop them into more advanced projects, like combining Lego bricks into a giant contraption. ðŸ˜‹ðŸŽŠ</p><p>SDIY Building Blocks is build to have circuits visual and playfull. Here and there I added some hints about what to do with concepts, but I wanted to keep the text as minimum as possible, and center around the simulations instead.</p><p>I also didn&#39;t add that much about electronic basics, like what transistors and capacitors are etc. I have no need to create another book, so maybe you already need to know just a little bit before you start using this site.</p><p>Anyways, if you do want to learn more about how and why things work as they do there is a ton of info available online of course, and I recently discovered that <a href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">gemini.google.com</a> can be very helpfull too. I also added a few books ðŸ“• below I&#39;ve read myself and enjoyed, so I think you might like them too.</p><p>The available building blocks in here are those I encountered during my SDIY journey. Some I found in books, some online, some in schematics, and some I designed myself. Nevertheless, there is sooo much more concepts that should be in here. Therefore I try to regularly update this site with new ideas.</p><p>Good luck, Louis-Pierre Geerinckx.</p><h3 id="make-electronics-3rd-edition" tabindex="-1">Make: Electronics, 3rd Edition <a class="header-anchor" href="#make-electronics-3rd-edition" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Make: Electronics, 3rd Edition&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>By Charless Platt.</p><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/cover/9781680456868/250w"><h3 id="encyclopedia-of-electronic-componets-vol-1" tabindex="-1">Encyclopedia of Electronic Componets, vol 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#encyclopedia-of-electronic-componets-vol-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Encyclopedia of Electronic Componets, vol 1&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>By Charless Platt.</p><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/cover/9781449333881/250w/"><h3 id="encyclopedia-of-electronic-componets-vol-2" tabindex="-1">Encyclopedia of Electronic Componets, vol 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#encyclopedia-of-electronic-componets-vol-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Encyclopedia of Electronic Componets, vol 2&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>By Charless Platt.</p><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/cover/9781449333881/250w/"><h3 id="make-analog-synthesizers" tabindex="-1">Make: Analog Synthesizers <a class="header-anchor" href="#make-analog-synthesizers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Make: Analog Synthesizers&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>By Ray Wilson.</p><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/cover/9781449356200/250w/"><h3 id="practical-electronics-a-complete-introduction" tabindex="-1">Practical Electronics: A complete introduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#practical-electronics-a-complete-introduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Practical Electronics: A complete introduction&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>By Andy Cooper</p><img src="https://wscovers1.tlsecure.com/cover?action=img&amp;source=88105&amp;ean=9781473614079&amp;size=l&amp;title=practical-electronics-a-complete-introduction&amp;format=img+&amp;size=l">',23)]))}const u=o(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
